# Link-Sling

## MVP

SMS backed free website that will send weblinks/messages to numbers on all mobile networks with 3 criteria being met:

* [x] Link/message
* [x] Phone number to send to
* [x] User info for who it was sent from

## Requirements

1) [x] Be able to send a web link or message via SMS to anyone by only entering the above 3 criteria.

2) User account that can save contact info, send group messages/links.

3) Authorization from receiver end to avoid abuse.

4) [x] Message history with timestamps, message contents.

## Stretch Goals

* Serve adds that conform to the Acceptable Adds program and the EFF Do Not Track privacy standard.
* Message history will show whether message was received.
* Authorization utilizes Captcha (give it half a day).
* O-Auth (give it half a day).
