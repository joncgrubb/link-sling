#Link-Sling

##Idea

SMS backed free website that will send weblinks/messages to numbers on all mobile networks with 3 criteria being met:

* Link/message
* Phone number to send to
* User info for who it was sent from

##User Stories

1) No login, no account, free. Be able to send a web link or message via SMS to anyone by only entering the above 3 criteria.
2) User account that can save contact info, send group messages/links, and use API to log in w/ Google+, Facebook, etc.
3) School/Company use to send links/messages to specific groups set up by the individual user or set up by company/school w/ permissions to certain users.
4) Being able to send Facebook links to non-facebook users so the original content is viewable by users not participating in Facebook.
