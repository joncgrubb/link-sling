Link-Sling is an application that utilizes the Twilio API to send text messages and web links from browser to mobile.

You can manage a Contacts list by adding, editing and deleting Contacts. A message History is also included that will show the receiver, message contents, date and status for each message. The app handles all incoming SMS and voice calls and instructs users how to interact with the app from mobile.

Link-Sling utilizes the Laravel PHP framework and a PostgreSQL object-relational database. The live version of Link-Sling is hosted as a Hobby provisioned Heroku application.
